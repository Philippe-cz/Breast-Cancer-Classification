# Breast-Cancer-Classification

I used transfer learning to classify benign and malignant images of breast cancer dataset. I used transfer learning as pre-trained InceptionResNetV2 with additional trainable Conv2D+DNN. During training i especially focused on recall metrics to evaluate model performance.
